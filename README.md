# Sqlite for UiPath

This set of activities allows you to work with a Sqlite files in UiPath

- Compatibility: net6.0 / UiPath Windows C# Project.

# Issues:

In order to use the SQLite.Interop.dll inside UiPath we need to copy it to our UiPath project root directory.
You can find these executables within the lib folder at the root of this codebase.
